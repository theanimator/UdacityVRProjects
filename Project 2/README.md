Time to complete: I probably spent about 4-5 hours playing with this project.
One thing I liked: I liked how much I learned about Unity with one project.
One thing that was challenging: Figuring out how to connect up the animation with the trigger was a little confusing because Unity didn't automatically create an animation controller for me.
