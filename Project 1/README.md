In it, please include your name, how long it took to complete the project, and one thing you liked and one thing that was challenging about this project.
Name: Laura Wieme
Time to complete: The exercise itself only took me 10-15 minutes. Updating my Xcode and then debugging errors and crashes took a couple of hours until I found the answer on the forum.
One thing I liked: It was actually pretty easy and fun to see the project running on my phone.
One thing that was challenging: XCode errors and a crashing app - seemed to be related to Metal
